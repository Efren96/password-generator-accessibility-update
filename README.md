# Password Generator Project

## About Project 

This week we were given starter code that included the HTML and CSS files but needed a Java Script file to be updated in order to access some of the prompts that the acceptance criteria asked of us. The acceptance criteria asked that the password generator include prompts like the length of the password,  weather you want to include uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers or symbols.

## Steps I Took To Complete Challenge 

* The first thing i did was create a new repository on GitHub and copy it on to my local machine.

* Then went over the acceptance criteria to make a checklist of the things that needed to be done.

* Then i made a script.js file and started by creating a function and adding all the variables to that function.

* I then started adding all of my if statements to make sure the prompts were being properly accessed.

* Last thing i added to my java script file was the for loop to make sure the pasword length was from 8-128 characters.

* I went over the acceptance criteria and made sure i checked everything off the list.

* Finally, once i felt like the password generator met all the criteria, i pushed it to GitHub.
